-- F7 allows private type decls in the .fs
   (Allow extra types in --f7 mode)

-- Ordering between interface and implementation
   (Ask Karthik for examples that exercise this. 
    Something related to circular refinements.)

-- Explain .prop as an internal reserved construct

-- F7 generates props for every data constructor
      -- Keep an eye out for this when comparing f7 vs fine z3 queries

-- Default mode for --f7 is  ghost refinements
   But, also support a mode that allows concrete refinements, 
    e.g, proof-carrying sessions.

-- Let's support inline type annotations in .fs
   and check them for consistency with types in .fs7
